#
# IdentityProvider gives the name and description of various forms of 
# identity respected by the system. When an identity is added to the share 
# table, it calls the formatters and validations found in this class, which 
# is necessary in some share types (like emails should be lowercase).
#
# Starting Providers are:
# "Privly Verified Email"
# "Privly Verified Domain"
# "Password"
# "IP Address"
