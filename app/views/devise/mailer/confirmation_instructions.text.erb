Welcome <%= @resource.email %>!

Privly is still in private alpha. The extension works on most sites, but there are <%= link_to "bugs", pages_bug_url %>, and we need more review before you should post anything private. When you find a problem, make sure you <%= link_to "report a bug", pages_bug_url %> so we can fix the problem for you. There are bound to be some rough edges when you are interfacing with the entire internet, but in most cases, Privly will work wherever you bring it.

The potential server demands for Privly are substantial. We are going to prioritize Developer and Tester (People who regularly submit bug reports) accounts above all others.

You can confirm your account through the link below:

<%= link_to 'Confirm my account', confirmation_url(@resource, :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token) %>


    Thanks!
