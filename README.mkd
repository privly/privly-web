## About ##

Privly is a developing set of browser extensions for protecting content wherever it is posted on the internet. It allows users to view content on any website, without the host site being able to read the content. This content server is meant to store content for users with a Privly extension.

For more information on what Privly is, [read about us](https://priv.ly/pages/about).

## Development Status ##

**[Burrowing Owl](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Burrowing) Alpha Version**

We are currently fixing bugs and developing the [cryptography library](https://github.com/privly/privly-library/) to package into the extensions. For more information about our development path, please see the [central wiki](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Version-List).

The Privly-Web content server is currently maintained by [Sean McGregor](https://github.com/smcgregor), on behalf of the [Privly Foundation](http://www.privly.org).

## About this Content Server ##

This server currently supports:

* Posting content from the extensions
* Two [Injectable Applications](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Injectable-Applications), including [Plain Posts](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Posts) and [ZeroBin](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/ZeroBin).
* Serialized JSON storage for any text content.
* Sharing by email, domain, and IP Address.

## Testing/Submitting Bugs ##

If you have discovered a bug, only [open a public issue](https://github.com/privly/privly-web/issues/new) on GitHub if it could not possibly be a security related bug. If the bug affects the security of the system, please report it privately at [privly.org](http://www.privly.org/content/bug-report). We will then fix the bug and follow a process of responsible disclosure.

There is a [setup guide](https://github.com/privly/privly-web/wiki/Setup-Guide-for-Developers) for this server on GitHub. The "master" branch of this repository is deployed to [dev.privly.org](https://dev.privly.org) and [privlyalpha.org](https://privlyalpha.org).

If you want a development account on a whitelisted content server (useful if you don't want to setup this server locally), contact Sean McGregor via one of the means below.

The [content server](https://github.com/privly/privly-web) hosted at [privlyalpha.org](https://privlyalpha.org) is currently closed to non-developers. If you setup your own content server, you can [manually add](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki/Manually-Adding-Domains-to-the-Whitelist) your domain to the extension's whitelist.

Discussion of system concepts and high level processes are found in the [central wiki](https://github.com/privly/privly-organization/wiki). Auto-generated code documentation for several repositories is found at [doc.privly.org](http://doc.privly.org).
